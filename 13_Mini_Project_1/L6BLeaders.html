        <ins>Ratan Tata: </ins>
        He became the chairman of the famed Tata Group in 1991 replacing his father JRD Tata. He was the guiding force behind Tata Consultancy Services when it started issuing shares and the listing of Tata Motors on the New York Stock Exchange. The Tata Indica range introduced in 1998 was pioneered by him. Another major achievement on his part was the acquisition of an Anglo-Dutch aluminium and steel producer Corus Group. Sealed on January 31, 2007 this deal helped to create the 5th biggest steel producing company of the world. Yet another successful acquisition was from Ford Motor Company of Jaguar & Land Rover. He had also envisaged a car that would be worth only INR 1 lakh. This dream was fulfilled with the Nano that was shown for the first time on January 10, 2008 at the New Delhi Auto Expo. It was formally introduced on March 23, 2009.
